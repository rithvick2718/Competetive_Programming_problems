## Competetive_Programming_problems
This git repository contains most of the problems of CP I have done. Right now I am working on udemy folder, that is I am still learning. I hope I start giving contests. And I haven't written this anywhere yet but I plan to practice CP even during exams i.e. atleast one question.

Also I have solved one problem from Japan Olympiad in Informatics and one problem from International Olympiad in Informatics.

I see one area I can improve is that I need to write more functions that solve a part of the problem rather that writing it into the main()

Lastly I am currently in Udemy Course Section 3
