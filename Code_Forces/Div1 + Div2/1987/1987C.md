### The Idea
$$
\text{dp}[i] = \max{\{\text{dp}[i+1] + 1, h_i\}}
$$

### Breakdown
We need to consider that $h_i$ can only become 0 after $h_{i+1}$ has become 0. Given that $1 \le h_i \le 10^9$ and $h_i$ can decrease only when $h_i > h_{i+1}$, we notice the following:

1. $\text{dp}[i] \ge h_i$

Let's examine what happens after $h_{i+1}$ turns 0. As $h_{i+1}$ goes to 0, there will be a point when $h_i > h_{i+1}$, leading to the following scenarios:

#### Case 1: $h_i > \text{dp}[i+1] + 1$
Since $\text{dp}[i] \ge h_i$, this means $h_i > \text{dp}[i+1] + 1 \ge h_{i+1} + 1$. 

- We have $h_i > h_{i+1} + 1$, and by the rules, we will never have $h_i < h_{i+1}$. 
- If we assume there is a point where $h_i = h_{i+1}$, then from that point $\text{abs}(h_i - h_{i+1}) \le 1$, so when $h_{i+1} = 0$, $h_i = 1$, making $\text{dp}[i] = \text{dp}[i+1] + 1$. However, since $\text{dp}[i] \ge h_i$, this creates a contradiction. 

Thus, we will always have $h_i > h_{i+1}$, so $\text{dp}[i] = h_i$.

#### Case 2: $h_i \le \text{dp}[i+1] + 1$
This case has two subcases:

##### Subcase 1: $h_i \le h_{i+1}$
- Eventually, $h_i = h_{i+1}$, and from this point $\text{abs}(h_i - h_{i+1}) \le 1$. 
- When $h_{i+1} = 0$, $h_i = 1$, making $\text{dp}[i] = \text{dp}[i+1] + 1$.

##### Subcase 2: $h_i > h_{i+1}$
- If we assume there is a point where $h_i = h_{i+1}$, from there, $\text{abs}(h_i - h_{i+1}) \le 1$, so $\text{dp}[i] = \text{dp}[i+1] + 1$. 
- For the latter case $h_i \ne h_{i+1}$ at any point by nature, we will never have $h_i < h_{i+1}$, so we have $h_i > h_{i+1}$. After $\text{dp}[i+1]$ seconds, the new $h_i$ will be $\text{old }h_i - \text{dp}[i+1]$. Since $h_i \le \text{dp}[i+1] + 1$, we must have new $h_i = 1$. Therefore, $\text{dp}[i] = \text{dp}[i+1] + 1$.

### Conclusion
From these cases, it is clear that:
$$
\text{dp}[i] = \max{\{\text{dp}[i+1] + 1, h_i\}}
$$
With $\text{dp}[n] = h_n$ and $\text{dp}[1]$ being our final answer.
