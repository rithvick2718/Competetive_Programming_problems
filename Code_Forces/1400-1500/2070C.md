## Why the solution for 2070C works
See that we can directly calculate minimum number of operations it will take to have a penality strictly $\le x$

The strategy for that is basically 
1. Ignore all the cells whose penality is $\le x$ 
2. When you see a blue cell whose penality is $\gt x$ then paint it blue and keep painting blue until you see a red cell whose penality is $\gt x$. One operation is utilized.
3. Now from this point till you see another blue cell with penality $\gt x$ do not paint at all as there could be a red cell with penality $\gt x$. When you see the blue cell with penality $\gt x$ then go to 2.

With the above procedure you guarantee that penality $\le x$ as all the cells that are $\gt x$ are painted the correct colour and you are minimizing the operations needed.

Now you see as $x$ increases the number of opeartions decreases or stays the same so this is a monotonic function. And when there is a monotonic function with x you can do a binary search
